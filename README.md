# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Movie-Reviews
Building Model to Analyze Sentiment of Movie Reviews (Kaggle Challenge)
This is a final project that I did in class with 2 other team mates. I was in charge of writing and putting all the codes together while my pals helped with building a wordlist to extract from the reviews. 

#The Rmarkdown file is the combination of 5 separate Rcode file in Rcode branch. I find it easier to divide the project into several chunks, so it is easier for trouble shooting.
